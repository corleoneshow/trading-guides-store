## Tips for Growth

### Hook Formula
Your first 3 seconds determine everything. Use these patterns:
- "You're losing money because of THIS..."
- "Nobody talks about this, but..."
- "Here's what I wish I knew before..."
- "Stop [doing X]. Do this instead."
- "[Number] + [Surprising claim]"

### Engagement Tactics
- Ask questions in captions: "Would you try this?"
- Reply to every comment (boosts algorithm)
- Post at least 1x/day for first 30 days
- Go Live occasionally (even just Q&A)

### What Performs Best
- Controversial takes
- Quick, actionable tips
- Mistakes/fails (people love these)
- Before/after results
- Duets with other trading content

---

## Troubleshooting

**"My videos get no views"**
- Check your hook - is it compelling in first 1 second?
- Are you posting at optimal times?
- Use trending sounds occasionally
- Engage with other creators in your niche

**"AI voice sounds robotic"**
- Try different voices in ElevenLabs
- Adjust stability/clarity settings
- Break up long sentences
- Add natural pauses with "..."

**"Videos look amateur"**
- Use consistent fonts/colors
- Add motion (zoom, pan on charts)
- Use captions (80% watch without sound)
- Keep cuts fast (2-4 seconds per scene)
